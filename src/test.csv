As many as 26 patients had died at the premier state-run hospital on Tuesday. A day after, on Wednesday, the Bombay high court had directed the Goa government to ensure that there are no more casualties at the hospital due to oxygen shortage. There were also unconfirmed reports of some deaths on Wednesday. “The oxygen interruptions are causing problems leading to deaths. Last night, the interruption that was caused between midnight and 8am caused 15 deaths,” GMC nodal officer Dr Viraj Khandeparkar told the high court, which is hearing a  regarding oxygen shortage. The horror unfolded around 1:25am on Thursday when relatives began making SOS calls saying that oxygen levels were dropping at GMC. Wards 143, 144, 145, 146 and 149 faced oxygen shortage. With oxygen pressure dropping, the SPO2 levels of patients on ventilators also dipped. Doctors made frantic calls to GMC’s senior officials and to Scoop Industries, the company contracted to supply oxygen cylinders to GMC, asking for oxygen supply to be looked into. Their calls went unanswered. “As far as piped oxygen is concerned, there was a dip in the night. There were small dips at least three-four times and one big dip of about half an hour,” GMC dean  told the high court.  said the patients who succumbed during the period were those who had a high severity score. Among the 15 who lost their lives in the early hours of Thursday was a couple. Their two young daughters were orphaned overnight. The government, particularly health secretary Ravi , insisted that the state had adequate oxygen and that the dip in supply was due to the changeover of oxygen cylinders and lack of trained drivers who could manoeuvre the cylinder trolley quickly. Dhawan’s assertion that “there is no dearth as such of oxygen” and that the deaths took place because of “logistical issues” did not find favour with the HC, which said that the authorities were in “denial mode”. “We are quite pained that such logistical issues should give rise to such serious consequences to Covid victims. We expect the state administration to find out ways and means to overcome these logistical issues, so that precious life is not lost on account of any deficiencies in the matter of supply of oxygen to the patients,” said Justices M S Sonak and Nitin W Sambre. Dhawan pinned the blame on inexperienced tractor drivers. “Between 1:45am and 2am, the driver who was bringing in the trolley got stuck in the pathway and that pathway can bring only one tractor down in reverse. The oxygen manifold is in the basement of GMC and the driver got stuck for 10-15 minutes and therefore, the changeover time was extra,” said Dhawan. The court said that the submissions made by the state were not appreciated. “These kinds of submissions are in the nature of a denial that the problem is elsewhere,” said Justice Sonak in an oral observation. With the court taking a stern line, the government decided to appoint a committee to inquire into the oxygen supply issue that has plagued GMC for over two weeks. The three-member committee consists of  Goa director , former dean of GMC Dr V N Jindal and urban development secretary Tariq Thomas. The committee will ascertain the adequacy of the oxygen supply and recommend improvement in the delivery system at GMC. ",[],Latest News,english

The surge in fatalities and cases during the pandemic's second wave has created an unprecedented health crisis where social media has become an important tool to seek and give emergency help. A lot of Indian cricketers have been doing their bit, ranging from making financial donations to helping people procure essential medical care. Vihari, while being in the UK for his county stint, has used his Twitter handle to amplify appeals for help. He has also created a team of 100 volunteers, comprising friends and followers from across Andhra Pradesh,  and . Just like Congress leader BV Srinivas in New Delhi, Vihari's friends and followers have reached people with plasma, oxygen cylinders and arranged food and hospital beds for patients. ""I don't want to glorify myself. I am doing it with the intention of helping people at the ground level, who actually need every help possible in these difficult times. It is just the start,"" the 27-year-old told PTI in an exclusive interview. Vihari left for England in early April to play in the English county for Warwickshire and is expected to join the Indian team directly in the UK when they arrive on June 3. Vihari, like every Indian, has been shocked by the obstacles that COVID-19 patients and their families have encountered on a daily basis. The difficulties have included finding something as basic as hospital beds, oxygen supplies and essential medicines. ""With the second wave being so strong, getting a bed became a difficulty and that is something which is unthinkable. So, I decided to use my followers as my volunteers and help as many people as I can,"" Vihari, who has more than 110,000 followers, said. ""My goal is to actually mainly reach out to those people who are not able to afford or arrange for plasma, beds and essential medicine. But this is not enough. I would like to do more service in the future,"" said the man, who has 624 runs in 11 Tests. For Vihari, when the distress calls and messages for help started pouring in, he wanted to create a network of help givers and he found that support from common people, his own family and Andhra teammates like Prithviraj Yarra. ""I built my own team. It's all about good intentions and people do get inspired and come out to help me. ""I have around 100 people on a WhatsApp group as volunteers and it's their hard work that we have been able to help a few people. Yes, I am a cricketer, well known but I am able to help because of their untiring efforts to reach the distressed,"" said Vihari. He started on Twitter but his team has now spread across various platforms to help and when he is not facing a Stuart Broad or  in the biting cold English weather, he personally ensures that he and his friends vet all the appeals for help. ""I started as one and now we have many friends in different platforms through my following on social media. I send them requests I get and they do the search. I chip in if any recommendations are required or to post on social media,"" Vihari said. ""Even my wife, sister and few of my Andhra teammates are part of my volunteer team. It's so heartening to see their support,"" Vihari said. I can do anything for team, even open if asked to do it again Talking about India's upcoming tour of England, Vihari said that if he is asked to open at some point during the five-Test series, he is not averse to the idea. ""I will do anything the team asks of me,"" said the man who batted for three and half hours with a torn hamstring to save the Sydney Test against Australia earlier this year. ""I batted top of the order most of my career so I'm familiar to the challenge,"" added Vihari. He had opened for India in the 2018-19 Test series in Australia. Vihari knows very well that  grabbed his chances during his injury-forced absence but he is keen on focussing on his own game. ""I am happy that he (Washington) did well but I would like to focus on my own game and try to control the controllables,"" said the soft-spoken man. But what about rolling his arms over more to give that balance to the side, he replied: ""I am working on my off-breaks."" Vihari was contracted to play three games for Warwickshire and his best show has been scores of 32 and 52 against Essex at Edgbaston, with  in the opposition ranks. ""It's been challenging as it's early part of the season but I have gained good experience. Getting used to the climate and pitches here is the idea. Hope it helps during the WTC final against New Zealand and the series against England,"" he said. Having enjoyed a successful A tour of UK back in 2018 followed by a half-century on Test debut at the Oval, Vihari loves playing in England and the challenges that one faces while countering seam and swing. ""It's a good place to play cricket. So I would enjoy the challenge,"" he said. Vihari is still in Birmingham where he is doing his daily routines and one thing that he is getting used to is the cold and damp conditions of early English summer. ""It is tough in this cold but again it's a different experience. Yes, I am still training in Birmingham,"" he signed off. ",[],Latest News,english

The Mumbai Indians fast bowler, who will lead India's attack in the upcoming World Test Championship (WTC) final against New Zealand, expressed his views in a video shared by his IPL franchise. ""I always try to talk to him even when I am not here and with the Indian team. So, it's been a good journey, and hopefully, every year I keep learning something new and try to add new things to my bowling. ""He has played a major role in that. It's been a great relationship so far, and hopefully, this continues for many many years to come,"" Bumrah said. He said he was always fascinated by how Bond bowled in his playing days and tries speaking to the MI bowling coach even when he is on India duty. ""I met him (Bond) for the first time in 2015. As a child, I had seen him bowl and was always very fascinated by how he used to bowl for New Zealand, and how he used to operate,"" the India pacer said. Bumrah, who has so far played 19 Tests, said that Bond assisted him a lot in broadening his horizon which in turn helped him blossom as a cricketer. ""When I met him over here, it was a good experience. He helped me a lot to open my mind to different things that I could try on the cricket field. So that was very good and that relationship has only gotten better each and every year,"" added the Gujarat pacer. Bond, on his part, termed Bumrah as the best death bowler in the world. Seasoned New Zealand left-arm pacer Trent Boult also had words of praise for his compatriot, saying that Bond was a ""tremendous thinker of the game and a pretty good tactician."" ""He has been here for a long time, he knows what he is doing and he puts in a lot of work into making sure that the bowlers are well equipped and have got enough information to make some decisions on the day. Yeah, really enjoy working with him,"" said Boult, who has played 71 Tests. ",[],Latest News,english
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-govt-may-extend-lockdown-over-high-covid-19-positivity-rates/articleshow/82624363.cms,Karnataka govt may extend lockdown over high Covid-19 positivity rates,"BENGALURU: The Karnataka government is reportedly considering extending the lockdown beyond May 24 as the Covid-19 positivity rate and deaths are still high in many districts. There are some signs that the second wave may ease by the first week of June, but experts have recommended a cautious approach to the government. Recently, Dr Balram Bhargava, the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said in an interview that restrictions should continue in places with a positivity rate of more than 10 per cent. Most Karnataka districts, except Chitradurga and Haveri, have a rate of over 10 per cent. Government officials said it was likely that the lockdown would be extended if the situation didn’t improve by May 20. The state government imposed a two-week curfew on April 28. As the measure failed to bring down the number of coronavirus infections, it enforced a strict lockdown of the same duration on May 10. It is finalising the next strategy by studying experts’ inputs. Multiple agencies, including the Lancet India Taskforce, have shared with the government strategies to contain the Covid-19 spread. A longer lockdown is among the recommendations. “The lockdown should be extended by at least a week in Karnataka after May 24, while stricter curbs for two weeks will be ideal. Considering various factors, including rising positivity and fatalities, the extension is necessary,” said epidemiologist Dr Giridhar R Babu, a member of the Lancet task force. The positivity rate is more than 30 per cent in eight districts, with Mysuru (38.1 per cent) topping the list. It is more than 20 per cent in 17 districts and over 10 per cent in four. Experts have cited multiple possible reasons for the higher levels of infectivity. Mutation of the virus is seen as the main one. Reverse migration because of the lockdown, mostly from Bengaluru to rural parts, is another major factor. “We must consider factors such as decreased number of tests and limiting of testing to symptomatic patients and their primary contacts at government labs. We had anticipated the present scenario as the reduced number of tests would naturally result in higher positivity rates,” said Dr MK Sudarshan, the chairman of the state technical advisory committee on Covid-19. He has found the current lockdown to be more effective than the partial one. The overall Covid situation may get better by May-end or the first week of June, according to three mathematical models that the committee has received from different agencies. “We have been giving reports and inputs regularly to the government and the subject of lockdown extension is under discussion. We will review the situation by May 20 and give our inputs to the government,” Dr Sudarshan added. Deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan said the government was studying all aspects. “A decision on the lockdown issue will be taken at an appropriate time,” he said. ",[],Latest News,english
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-populi-poor-without-smartphones-feel-left-out/articleshow/82616804.cms,Mumbai: Vax populi? Poor without smartphones feel left out,"MUMBAI: Ghanshyam Mishra was among millions who welcomed ‘Tika Utsav,’ a celebration of the mass vaccination programme (April 11-April 14) PM Modi announced. But reality hit home hard last week when Mishra, a rickshaw driver, took a day off from work to queue up outside a vaccination centre, only to be told that he could not get the jab because he was not registered on the CoWin app. He came later, after his college-going son who owns a smartphone booked a slot for him. Mishra, 50, originally from Jaunpur (UP), can be called privileged among his peers as his family owns at least one smartphone and could get the first dose. Thousands of other poor migrants, daily wagers, domestic help and semi-literate workers at construction sites have not got vaccinated yet because they lack access to smartphones. Since they are not techno-savvy, the poor find it tedious to book a slot for vaccination even if they get access to smartphones. Dongri resident Farook Wakanerwala, 50, who worked as a supervisor at a construction site earlier, said he has been using the same phone for over 10 years. “I never felt the need to buy a smartphone as I find it convenient to use this handset. It has been with me for years and is easy to use. Booking a slot for me now seems a problem. I have two kids who are aged 20 and 22 years, but they have no time to sit and search for a slot for me. I am therefore not even trying to go and take the vaccine,” he said. Wadi Bunder housewife, 65-year-old Aparna Jadhav, said there is a vaccination centre in her locality, but she needs to book an appointment online. “I do not have a smartphone, nor does anyone else in my family. Now just for the sake of taking the jab, I will not consider buying one. I would rather wait to see if they allow walk-ins again,” Jadhav said. Lack of smartphones is a handicap for many Tamilians in Dharavi. “60% of migrants from Tamil Nadu do not have access to smartphones,” said Srithar Tamilan of Mumbai Vizhithezhu Iyakkam, an association of Tamil residents of Dharavi. It had sent a list of demands on behalf of Maharashtra’s 25-lakh-odd Tamil migrants to each of the parties contesting the TN elections recently. The letter also sought a separate ministry that would maintain records of migrants outside the state to ease distribution of welfare measures in emergencies. Ravi Raja, opposition leader in BMC, said, “Our party workers sit with computers to register people online, but the problem is people can get a slot anywhere in the city. For instance, people living in F North ward may get a slot in R Central. A person from a Sion slum will have to travel to Borivli for a shot. Many people are now simply waiting for things to ease.” ",[],Latest News,english

A day after receiving online flak from Indian fans for his ""side show"" comments on Indian team, Paine clarified himself while chatting with former Australian wicketkeeper batsman Adam Gilchrist in a podcast. ""I was asked a number of things, and one of those was talking about the challenges of playing against India. One of them is the distraction they can create,"" Paine said in the 'Gilly and Goss podcast' on Friday. ""There was a lot of talk that they weren't going to Brisbane. They're always changing gloves and bringing out physios and all that can get on your nerves. Just said that was one of the things that probably distracted me and took my eye off the ball at times."" The 36-year-old Paine had said that his team was distracted by the Indian team's ""niggling"" during the epoch-making Test series early this year which the visitors rallied to win despite being ravaged by injuries. Soon Paine was trolled on twitter by Indian fans. ""I did say that they simply outplayed us and that they deserved to win but they left that one out. The Indian fans have been slamming me on social media. They say that I'm making excuses again but it's all good fun,"" Paine said. ""Absolutely, I think anytime an Australian captain speaks publicly is gonna to see the light of the day, there's no doubt about that. Like I said, it was a wide-ranging interview for a long period of time. ""I certainly wasn't making any excuses. I was asked about some of the challenges of the summer, and I said that was one of them for me,"" he added. Paine said he doesn't mind getting ""a bit of stick"" and despite all the criticism he still loves his Indian fans. ""I love Indian fans. I don't mind getting a bit of stick, particularly when you deserve it. They ripped me off in the summer when I dropped those catches, that was totally fair. ""I love the passion...I love how much they love cricket. I like how much they interact. For some people it's positive interaction... most of the time they are into me, but I don't mind that."" India prevailed 2-1 in the rubber that went down as one of the greatest bilateral contests of all time. India bounced back from being 36 all out in the opening Test to humble the home side despite, at one time, struggling to put together a fit playing XI. India sealed the series at Gabba after scripting a record chase of 328 with 19 balls remaining on the final day for a thrilling three-wicket win. ",[],Latest News,english

After undergoing a back surgery in 2019, Hardik has not bowled regularly since his comeback and not being able to offer his all-round skills cost him a place in the Indian Test squad for the UK tour. Sarandeep, whose tenure ended with the historic tour of Australia earlier this year, was also surprised that a rare talent like Prithvi Shaw did not even make the standbys for the England tour. ""The selectors' decision to ignore Hardik for Tests is understandable. He has not been able bowl regularly after his surgery. I feel he has to bowl 10 overs in ODIs and four in T20s to be part of the playing XI even in shorter formats. He can't just play as a batsman,"" Sarandeep, a former India spinner, told PTI. ""If Hardik doesn't bowl, it disturbs the balance of the side hugely. You have to play an extra bowler because of that and someone like Surykumar Yadav has to miss out. As we saw in the ODI series against England and Australia, we can't play with five bowling options. ""Then team now has other all-rounders in Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Jaddu is back, Shardul Thakur can also be an all-rounder, he has shown that. They all can do the job if Hardik can't bowl."" Talking about Shaw not being picked for the UK tour, Sarandeep said it is way too early to sideline a batsman like him. ""He has the potential to do what Sehwag did for India. You can't sideline him so early in his career. He has scored tons of runs in domestic cricket after being dropped post Australia tour. He has corrected his technical flaws also and look how he played in the IPL. ""You have to back a talent like Shaw and even someone like Shubman Gill (he is in the team but did not gets runs against England at home) for that matter."" The four standbys picked for the UK tour are opener Abhimanyu Easwaran, pacers Avesh Khan, Prasid Krishna and Arzan Nagwaswalla. ""Priyank Panchal got a hundred for India A in New Zealand. You have not picked him. You have not picked Devdutt Padikkal who also scored tons of runs. For the left-arm pacer's slot, I fail to understand why Jaydev Unadkat is being ignored. ""He picked 67 wickets (a record) in the last Ranji Trophy and a lot of them came on the flat track of Rajkot,"" added Sarandeep. Sarandeep, who works for ONGC, is pulling off night shifts at the moment, working with the COVID-relief team of his employer. ""It is a massive company. I am part of the team which is helping its people all around the country with oxygen supplies, arranging plasma for the needy and finding hospital beds.

Class 6 passed staring at a laptop screen, and now he is in class 7. But even online school’s closed early this summer because many teachers and students have fallen ill in the second wave. Some teachers have died. How long can this go on? School is not just about reading, writing and arithmetic. Children spend time together and learn important social skills. These are skills they can learn only from each other, not . But for the second year running, India’s children are under house arrest. There is only one quick way out of this spot — vaccinate parents fast. Luckily, even after all its mutations the  virus is not too dangerous for children. Only about 0.008% of children need hospitalisation for Covid, says a recent article in The Atlantic. That means, if 12,500 children get Covid, just one might land up in hospital. Experts say the risk is comparable to flu. Not so for parents, though. The second wave has sickened and killed many people in their 30s and 40s. Most parents of school-going children are in this age group. It is also a group that the government’s vaccination drive has neglected so far. If parents are vaccinated, children won’t take the virus from home to school, nor carry it home to vulnerable family members. We could open schools safely then. The US authorised Pfizer’s vaccine for children aged 12-15 just this week. It is an important step for a return to normal. But in the same Atlantic article, scientists Tracy Beth Hoeg,  and Monica Gandhi call for the US to delay vaccinating children and donate “tens of millions of additional doses” to help hard-hit countries like India. They say vaccinating adults around the world is extremely important now for “gaining better control of the disease…and preventing or slowing the emergence of worrisome viral variants.” New cases have fallen sharply in Israel and the UK, where more than half of all adults have got at least one vaccine dose. While a tiny percentage of children with “immune deficiencies, certain cancers and severe obesity” need vaccination urgently, the rest can wait, they say. There’s another important reason for vaccinating parents of school-going children urgently. In the US, people in the 20-49 age group are responsible for more than 70% of all infections, the scientists say. That’s because each infected adult, on average, infects more than one person. Children don’t spread Covid so well. So, the immediate risk in reopening schools is not so much from the mingling of children as from their unvaccinated parents. Scientists say a third Covid wave is very likely in a few months from now. Next time, the virus might change in a way that makes it prey on children. A Bloomberg report says the 14-17 age group already has the second highest infection rate in the US, where a very large percentage of adults are vaccinated.  says 22% of new cases in the US are among children. Last year, they made up just 3% of cases. If children become Covid’s main target in the next wave, how will unvaccinated parents care for them? Cardiac surgeon Devi Shetty raised this question in a TOI article published on Thursday. He says India has 16.5 crore children below the age of 12. Even if one in every thousand becomes seriously ill with Covid, how will we cope with only 2,000 children’s ICU beds? Besides, children can’t be left in the care of nurses entirely — babies need to be , older kids need familiar faces around. And children in a Covid ICU cannot be sedated because “they need to breathe well to maintain oxygenation.” He recommends quickly vaccinating all the parents of young children with two doses. There’s no other way out. ",[],Latest News,english

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indu-jain-she-walked-with-seers-but-always-had-her-feet-on-the-ground/articleshow/82612182.cms,"She walked with seers, but always had her feet on the ground","Chairman, Mataji, Mummy, dispenser of wisdom and breakfast poha, landlady? How many ways did I know the beauteous Indu Jain? Most of us at the TOI Group first met her after she took over as Chairman after the passing of her husband. She changed the nameplate on the solid teak office door to ‘Chair Prasanna’. In a couple of months, the designation reverted to the conventional. The occupant remained anything but. Indu Jain had arrived from the polar opposite of the empire suddenly at her command. She had evolved through satsangs promoting peace and universal humanhood; media thrived on clashes – political and economic, social, civic and celeb. She had walked with believers; cynicism was a professional imperative for journalists. She was the boss, so open revolt wasn’t possible; but you couldn’t miss the clatter of collectively dropped jaws that met her diktats. The new Chairman wanted a kinder, gentler, happier newspaper. How is it possible, we grumbled, when doom and gloom are the raison d'etre of media, when the age-old mantra was 'good news is no news'? But you know what? From this conflicted churning emerged an antidote to troubled times: the positive stories of human goodness which lit the way out of the catastrophic events that hit the nation --droughts, floods, cyclones, major accidents, terror attacks. This has continued in the latest, arguable worst scourge of all. During the the pandemic, the Times of India has given prime space to the series, ‘Shot of Hope’ and ‘Beacons of Hope’. It wasn’t only staffers who were disconcerted by Indu-ji’s unorthodox style. Wanting to celebrate Shakti, she invited a score of Mumbai’s top corporate women to a ‘summit’. They fidgeted uncomfortably in their power suits/ saris as she asked them to join her in a sonorous ‘Aummm’. ‘Mataji’ – as she was deferred to on account of her spiritual persona -- was also touchingly ‘Mummy’. In the midst of a top-level company meeting, she walked across the length of that imperious Bombay boardroom with a plate of toast for ‘VC’, her elder son, Samir Jain, presiding at the other end. On another occasion, when her younger son, ‘MD’, Vineet Jain came straight from Delhi to the Directors Lunch Room filled with senior managers and editors, Mummy stopped mid-bite to go plant a kiss on his cheek. It must surely be unique in the annals of corporate history. Indu-ji had a voracious appetite for new information, concepts and, yes, food too. Her slender frame belied this, but this was the secret. When she said she was sampling a dish ‘just for taste’, it was just that, not a spoonful, but the tip of a spoon. That, and small meals at frequent intervals. Along with a steady serving of just-squeezed juices. That willowy frame was always swathed in her own designed whites, making her own sartorial statement. I really got the measure of Mataji when I rejoined the TOI as resident editor, Delhi, in 2003. I was generously offered accommodation at ‘Chhey Number’, the Chairman’s residence at 6 SP Marg. Invited for breakfast in her suite of rooms, we would chat till an almost imperceptible shift in key indicated that I should leave her to get on with her massages and messages. I realized how lightly she wore the wisdom she had absorbed over the years. How, for all that other-worldliness, she was totally in control. It was evident in in the eagle-eye she kept on the retinue that staffed the cavernous kitchen, on every item of the bungalow’s inventory, right down to the number of flower pots lining the manicured lawn. More spectacularly, her doubled Uttar Pradesh and Jain DNA helped her bring her very own baby, Times Foundation, to global attention with its agenda of peace, ecology and spiritualism. Speaking of which, in my two years at that marbled Jain House, I also saw the attention Mataji personally paid to the comforts of her visiting spiritual soul-mates: Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev and of course Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, who had a long and abiding relationship with the whole family. Sri Sri was the chief guest, as much loved as honoured, when Mataji’s Times Foundation acolytes celebrated her 70th at Jain House. The birthday girl was as effervescent as a 17- year-old. In Jain tradition, her passing is not to be mourned; instead the liberation of the soul is to be celebrated. But there’s no bar on my deeply missing a woman who walked with seers, but had her feet decidedly on the ground. ",[],Latest News,english

Terming the circular as discriminatory in nature and also as one that runs contrary to the provisions of the Epidemics Act and the disaster management Act which the circular too cited as its basis, the bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy issued notice to the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and central government asking them to file their counters on the need to bring in a uniform policy governing admissions in hospitals during the ongoing pandemic driven crisis period. The bench took up an urgent petition filed by retired IRS officer Garimella Venkata Krishna Rao. Rao questioned the action of the Telangana state police authorities in stopping at the state borders the ambulances entering into the state of Telangana. The bench earlier directed the state not to block the ambulances at the borders. The court in its previous hearing asked the state to brief the people and authorities of neighboring states about the ground realities in Hyderabad while restraining its police from physically stopping the ambulances at the border. The Telangana government then issued a circular asking the neighboring states to first obtain permission from its hospitals and police before driving the Covid-19 patients into Hyderabad. While the Telangana government is arguing that it has an inherent power to protect its people during a pandemic, the Andhra Pradesh government too entered the fray and said that the action of the former goes against the laws it cited in support of its circular and wanted the passage to be free from barriers. The case was posted to June 17 for further hearing. ",[],Latest News,english

The 26-year-old had missed the IPL due to an elbow injury that he sustained during England's tour of India. After recovering from the injury, Archer turned out for Sussex in a County Championship game against Kent on Thursday and finished with figures of 2 for 29 from his 13 overs. ""If I did go to India, I probably would have come home early anyway. Hopefully, if it (IPL) does get rescheduled for this year, I will be able to go again,"" said Archer on Sussex Cricket YouTube channel. ""It was a hard decision not to go to India, it was really unpredictable, I could have gone but I don't know how many games I would have played."" The IPL was indefinitely suspended last Tuesday after multiple COVID cases inside the bio-bubble. Archer, who had picked up 20 wickets for his IPL team Rajasthan Royals last season, said: ""Rajasthan Royals and England supported me in my decision. You obviously built a good relationship as I have been with the Royals for the last three years. ""Stokes too suffered a bit, I think going over his hand and I don't even know if he is going to be ready for these Tests against New Zealand,"" he added, referring to the hand injury which ruled Stokes out of the IPL. Playing his first competitive match in more than one and a half months, Archer on Thursday scalped the wickets of Zak Crawley and opposition skipper Bell Drummond, as Kent were bundled out for 145. ""My fitness is fine. I thought I bowled okay. I played in the (Sussex) second team last week and it's good to get some confidence and I felt fine,"" a pleased Archer said. ""I bowled in short spells for protection in case we had a long day but it was overcast, which helped a bit. There was a bit of management, but it all worked out."" Archer, whose last appearance was the fifth T20I between India and England on March 20, was struggling with a freak hand injury and later underwent a surgery to remove a glass fragment from a tendon on his right hand after an attempt to clean his fish tank went wrong. He had sustained the injury at his home in January and the surgery was conducted while he was still undergoing treatment for a long-term elbow injury. The injury woes forced Archer to pull out of the now-suspended IPL 2021. The ongoing match is Archer's last chance to prove his fitness ahead of England's Test series against New Zealand, which starts on June 2 at Lord's. ",[],Latest News,english

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-kids-behaviour-changing-due-to-covid-curbs/articleshow/82623853.cms,Madhya Pradesh: Kids behaviour changing due to Covid curbs,"BHOPAL: Fearing a third wave,  have put  under different restrictions even on their moving out of the home. As a result, children who have already been under stress for the past one year as their schools are closed, have started developing psychological disorders like aggression and violence, forcing the parents to reach out to psychologists. Sarvesh Verma, father of a class 5 student, was diagnosed with  last year. The fear of Covid in him had developed such that he had asked everyone to be at home and put all kinds of restrictions on movement of his children. “Gradually, I realized recently that my son had started reacting to every issue. He was quite violent also. Someone asked me to consult a psychologist. He told me to change my behaviour with my son as well as with the family. He asked me to be cool and calm and create an environment where less is talked about the  on Covid. Within a few days, I saw changes in my son’s behaviour,” said Verma. He added, “I think my biggest mistake was not understanding the psychology of the kid who has been inside the home for over a year now. Obviously, restrictions are important in the ongoing situation but I was compensating it by making a good environment at home. After I made changes in my behaviour things have also changed.” Sarvesh is not the only father who has witnessed such sudden changes in behaviour of their children. Psychologist Dr Satykant  said that this is a crucial time for parents as their kids are facing different kinds of challenges. “Ever since the pandemic has surfaced, parents have been visiting me with the problem like their wards are becoming more aggressive and acting differently. This is a situation in which we have to understand it deeply,” said Dr Trivedi. He suggested that parents should develop a calm environment at home. “Children are having more screen time at home. Due to online classes, it has become a habit for them to sit with gadgets,” said Dr Trivedi. He said, “When children are not moving out, they would spend more time with gadgets. Here, comes the role of parents. They have to develop an atmosphere where they must spend more time with their children. Involve them with indoor games like carrom, chess or even vernacular games. Talk to them on different topics for long hours. This way, we can help our children facing the situation. Parents need not to panic and they should talk about positive things with children. Same will help older people in families too.” ",[],Latest News,english
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-great-unknown-will-not-disappoint/articleshow/82613816.cms,'The other side beckons... I can’t wait to explore it',"Priya Atmavar, The art of dying must be an extension of art of living. I have been privileged to have lived a life of comfort, but it is the unwalled joys that have been the most rewarding. Every facet of my life has shone with contentment, and indeed, a tranquillity brought on by a sense of accomplishment. I have never had to yearn for anything. The only lack has been that of unhappiness. Is that lack, or luck, or something more profound? It doesn’t matter. Of course, like all mortal beings, there have been several occasions and reasons for feeling dissatisfied. But, on each such occasion, I asked myself, “is there any need to punish oneself with unhappiness?” The answer has always swiftly banished such negative thoughts. This is why I am certain that, as with the sojourn, the departure from life too will be amidst the surround-sound of pleasure, and more so, excitement. All these years, I have always been restless for new experiences. Now, to tell you the truth, this life has become jaded. One has had the privilege to have been there, done that, bought the T-shirt. Now, as for an adventure traveller, the last frontier beckons, demanding to be experienced. Of this, I am certain: the never-before destination, the great unknown will not disappoint. Everyone has talked of its mystery: us paar na jaane kya hoga, us paar jaroor kucch naya hoga. I can’t wait to explore it. Having said all this, I would want to go aaram se. Tell death, very sweetly of course, to wait a bit while I adjust my pillow just so and snuggle into my quilt for the right degree of warmth. I am not worried about settling matters of this world. Material bonds are already being untied as I gravitate towards my last halt before the final destination. NO, not Banaras, this will be some tranquil ashram away from worldly cares and cries. My friends are being prepared for my departure. Those close to me, and really know me, don’t need these consolatory noises. They know that I will embrace death with the same uninhibited celebration with which I have hugged life. In this aware club are my gurus who have nurtured and pampered me. Sometimes, I have a quiet laugh when thinking of those who will mourn for me. Poor things. They are the ones in need of a comforting pat because they don’t know what a lot of fun I intend having out there. If there is a last wish, It is this. No one should be informed of my departure. No one needs to ask “where is Indu?” Because, wherever there is laughter, they will find her there. The body’s soulless shell can be cremated in whichever way the ashramites feel best – my guru will surely wing to my side from wherever he is. Then, I will fly, flirting with the fire, land, water, air and space in a long-awaited meeting-mating milan. Always me in you. Love Indu Jain",[],Latest News,english
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/mosques-disappear-as-china-strives-to-build-a-beautiful-xinjiang/articleshow/82627957.cms,Mosques disappear as China strives to 'build a beautiful Xinjiang',"QIRA: The Jiaman mosque in the city of Qira, in the far western Chinese region of Xinjiang, is hidden behind high walls and Communist Party propaganda signs, leaving passersby with no indication that it is home to a religious site. In late April, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, two ethnic Uyghur women sat behind a tiny mesh grate, underneath a surveillance camera, inside the compound of what had long been the city's largest place of worship. Reuters could not establish if the place was currently functioning as a mosque. Within minutes of reporters arriving, four men in plain clothes showed up and took up positions around the site, locking gates to nearby residential buildings. The men told the reporters it was illegal to take photos and to leave. ""There's no mosque here ... there has never been a mosque at this site,"" said one of the men in response to a question from Reuters if there was a mosque inside. He declined to identify himself. Minarets on the building's four corners, visible in publicly available satellite images in 2019, have gone. A large blue metal box stood where the mosque's central dome had once been. It was not clear if it was a place of worship at the time the satellite images were taken. In recent months, China has stepped up a campaign on state media and with government-arranged tours to counter the criticism of researchers, rights groups and former Xinjiang residents who say thousands of mosques have been targeted in a crackdown on the region's mostly Muslim Uyghur people. Officials from Xinjiang and Beijing told reporters in Beijing that no religious sites had been forcibly destroyed or restricted and invited them to visit and report. ""Instead, we have taken a series of measures to protect them,"" Elijan Anayat, a spokesman for the Xinjiang government, said of mosques late last year. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday some mosques had been demolished, while others had been upgraded and expanded as part of rural revitalisation but Muslims could practise their religion openly at home and in mosques. Asked about restrictions authorities put on journalists visiting the area, Hua said reporters had to try harder to ""win the trust of the Chinese people"" and report objectively. Reuters visited more than two dozen mosques across seven counties in southwest and central Xinjiang on a 12-day visit during Ramadan, which ended on Thursday. There is a contrast between Beijing's campaign to protect mosques and religious freedom and the reality on the ground. Most of the mosques that Reuters visited had been partially or completely demolished. China has repeatedly said that Xinjiang faces a serious threat from separatists and religious extremists who plot attacks and stir up tension between Uyghurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han, China's largest ethic group. A mass crackdown that includes a campaign of restrictions on religious practice and what rights groups describe as the forced political indoctrination of more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims began in earnest in 2017. China initially denied detaining people in detention camps, but has since said they are vocational training centres and that the people have “graduated” from them. The government says there are more than 20,000 mosques in Xinjiang but no detailed data on their status is available. Some functioning mosques have signs saying congregants must register while citizens from outside the area, foreigners and anyone under the age of 18 are banned from going in. Functioning mosques feature surveillance cameras and include Chinese flags and propaganda displays declaring loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. Visiting reporters were almost always followed by plainclothes personnel and warned not to take photographs. A Han woman, who said she had moved to the city of Hotan six years ago from central China, said Muslims who wanted to pray could do so at home. ""There are no Muslims like that here anymore,"" the woman said, referring to those who used to pray at the mosque. She added: ""Life in Xinjiang is beautiful."" Some state-sanctioned mosques are shown off to visiting journalists and diplomats, like the Jiaman Mosque in Hotan. ""Everything is paid for by the party,"" said a Hotan official at the mosque on a visit arranged for Reuters by the city propaganda department. The official, who went by the nickname ""Ade"" but declined to give his full name, said men were free to pray at the mosque five times a day, according to Islamic custom. While reporters were there, several dozen men, most of them elderly, came to pray as dusk fell. Afterwards, they broke their fast with food provided by the local government. The mosque, more than 170 years old, is one of four in the region earmarked as cultural relics, with funds for renovation from the central government, the Xinjiang government said. As the mosque's leader or imam removed his shoes, Ade demonstrated a machine given by the government that shrink-wraps shoes in plastic. ""Now you don't even need to take your shoes off in the mosque, it's very convenient,"" he said. In Changji, about 40 km west of the regional capital, Urumqi, green and red minarets of the city's Xinqu Mosque lay broken below a Chinese flag flying over the deserted building's courtyard. Reuters analysed satellite imagery of 10 mosques in Changji city and visited six of them. A total of 31 minarets and 12 green or gold domes had been removed within a period of two months after April 2018, according to dated images. At several mosques, Islamic architecture was replaced with Chinese-style roofing. These included Changji's Tianchi road mosque, whose gold dome and minarets were removed in 2018, according to publicly available satellite images. The Xinjiang government did not respond to a request for comment on the state of mosques in the region. Researchers at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimated in 2020, after a survey of 900 Xinjiang locations, that 16,000 mosques had been partially or completely destroyed over the previous three years. Signs outside the Xinqu Mosque, with the crumbling minarets, said a housing development would soon be built on the site. ""For ethic unity, build a beautiful Xinjiang,"" a sign read.

India head the table after gaining one rating point for an aggregate of 121, having accumulated 2914 points from 24 matches. Virat Kohli's men are closely followed by their World Test Championship final opponents, New Zealand, with a rating of 120. The Kiwis have garnered 2166 points from 18 Tests and gained two rating points. India's 2-1 win over Australia and 3-1 win over England over the past year and New Zealand's 2-0 series wins over the West Indies and Pakistan have helped them keep ahead of the pack. According to an ICC statement, the latest annual update eliminates results of 2017-18. The latest update rates all matches played since May 2020 at 100 per cent and those of the previous two years at 50 per cent. England (109 rating) have climbed a place to third at the expense of Australia (108 rating), down to fourth now. England's jump came after their 0-4 defeat to Australia in 2017-18 was dropped from the rankings. Pakistan (94) have gained three points but remained at fifth spot, while West Indies (84), who beat Bangladesh 2-0 and drew 0-0 with Sri Lanka in series played this year, have jumped two places to sixth, their best position since 2013. South Africa (80) and Sri Lanka (78) have dropped a rung each to seventh and eighth positions respectively, followed by Bangladesh (46), who have lost five points and Zimbabwe (35), who gained eight points. The Proteas, thus, have equalled their lowest in Test ranking history. India and New Zealand will square off in the inaugural World Test Championship final at Southampton's Ageas Bowl from June 18 to 22. ",[],Latest News,english
