A diamond polisher in Surat, he had to sell family jewellery to pay for their coaching class fees to crack NEET exams. <br>With a monthly income of about Rs 10,000 Bapodariya says he had to borrow from friends and relatives to pay the Rs 3 lakh fees for securing his son’s admission in the medical college at Patan. The twins completed their schooling from Jeevan Bharati Education School, Surat. <br>“Prince wanted to become a software engineer. I told him to choose a career in medicine looking at his excellent academic performance in the past. The other son always wanted to be a doctor,” said the father of the twins. <br>The number of twins getting entry in medical colleges together has risen in the last few years. About two years ago, there were barely a couple of such cases. Last year seven twins secured admission in medical colleges in Gujarat. <br>Like these twin brothers, the twin sisters Krina Dobariya (NEET score: 631 marks) and Kenvi Dobariya (NEET score: 574 marks) have got admission in MBBS studies at Pandit Dindayal Upadhyay Medical College, Rajkot and GMERS Medical College, Gotri. <br>Their father Sanjay Dobariya, a Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) doctor could not be more proud. <br>“I missed making it to MBBS course by a few marks. My twin daughters have fulfilled my dream,” he said. <br>The two sisters, who went to Rajkot’s Premier School, constantly supported each other in their studies. <br>“My sister is very clever and has a better grasping power than me. She can memorize rather quickly,” said Kenvi. <br>Take the case of Janvi Mithapara and Janki Mithapara who hail from Gondal. While Janki (Neet score: 516 marks) bagged a medical seat at GMERS Medical College at Vadnagar, Janvi (NEET score: 563 marks) has got admission in M P Shah Government Medical College at Jamnagar. The sisters have not attended any coaching class or taken tuitions. Instead they relied on each other to solve problems for cracking NEET. <br>Their father, Sailesh Mithapara is a diamond polisher who says he is determined to make his daughters complete their study and pursue postgraduation, even if it meant putting in extra hours of work for him. <br>Sailesh Mithapara, who has four children in all, said he took a loan for paying his daughter fees for Vadnagar medical college. <br>For Jayesh Khatra, a labour contractor from a humble background, his daughter Devanshi (NEET score: 523 marks) was always brighter than her twin brother Devansh (NEET score: 500 marks).

Instead, the 53-year-old has been on a virtual tour from his home in Paris, meeting with managers, workers and customers around the globe. <br>He’s trying to turn around the struggling business without letting the Covid-19 pandemic slow him. Delaporte slashed the top ranks of leadership from 25 people to four. He stepped up acquisitions, with more on the way. Mostly, he focused his attention on customers, meeting with 130 over video conference and helping to land new multi-year contracts with clients in the US and Europe. <br>The company’s stock has rallied about 70% since his appointment, most among India’s four largest outsourcing firms during that period. It’s a rare victory for Wipro, but one the veteran of France’s Capgemini SE is determined won’t be its last. He hopes to get Wipro back on track after years of tumult and stagnating financials. <br>“There’s a particular momentum in the industry just now, and I want to drive that urgency to put Wipro back where it belongs,” said Delaporte, speaking from Paris in his first interview since assuming the CEO post. “I know I’m good at one thing - getting things done.” <br>Wipro needs more than enthusiasm. The firm, majority owned by billionaire <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Azim-Premji"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" data-ga=""within_article-topic_link|topic_Azim-Premji"" frmappuse=""1"">Azim Premji</a>, has lagged its peers for years. In the fiscal year ended in March, revenues rose 3.9% in constant currency terms, compared with 9.8% at Infosys Ltd and 7.1% at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd -- even though both are far larger. HCL Technologies Ltd, which displaced Wipro as the third-largest in the industry two years ago, grew 17%. <br>Delaporte’s predecessor, Abidali Neemuchwala, took over in 2016 with similar ambitions. He departed after a turbulent four years and falling well short of a target to build Wipro into a $15 billion company by 2020. (Its revenue for the year ended in March was $8.1 billion.) <br>“Thierry seems to have the vision and the commitment, but he has an absolutely daunting task,” said Vasupradha Srinivasan, a senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc. <br>Delaporte, whose hobby is long-distance running, is realistic that any turnaround will take time. But, he argues, the business is actually simple: Obsess over helping your clients and the rest will follow. <br>“We know what we need to do to make it work,” he said, from an office whose walls are adorned with paintings. “In my Year One, we’ll accelerate growth; in Year Two, we’ll be at the growth level of our competitors; and in Year Three, we will outdo.” <br>While the US is Wipro’s biggest market now, Delaporte sees opportunity in Europe and Asia. He’s put together a new deals team -- headed by a chief growth officer -- to go after big client contracts. In the last few weeks, Wipro has landed orders from European clean energy producers Fortum Oyj and E.On SE. <br>The company has also stepped up its acquisitions. He says he has signed more deals in the past five months than in the previous five years -- and plans to keep going. <br>“I am confident you will see a bolder and a more ambitious Wipro as we move ahead,” said <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rishad-Premji"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" data-ga=""within_article-topic_link|topic_Rishad-Premji"" frmappuse=""1"">Rishad Premji</a>, the company’s chairman. <br>Picked from a crowded field of candidates, Delaporte was a surprise choice. The Frenchman is the first CEO of an India-based outsourcer who’s not of Indian ethnicity, a cultural shift that reflects the industry’s transition. <br>The business used to be simple, pay-by-the-hour labor arbitrage where Indian firms could substitute their own workers for more highly compensated tech staff in the US and Europe. Now firms need to deliver innovation and strategic insights, helping their customers figure out new ways to capitalize on cloud computing, data analytics and artificial intelligence. The challenge of that new mission is reflected in industry growth rates that were once regularly in double digits and have since crashed. <br>The <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/coronavirus"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" data-ga=""within_article-topic_link|topic_https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/coronavirus"" frmappuse=""1"">coronavirus</a> hammered the business this year.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/greek-slaves-and-flute-girls-in-gujarat/articleshow/79597283.cms,,Greek slaves and flute girls in Gujarat,"<div class=""ga-headlines"">AHMEDABAD: India’s western region had always fascinated travellers, traders and explorers alike. But to gain access to this bustling trade centre, a number of Greek travelogue sources has revealed how western traders were instructed to give “gifts” of beautiful concubines and slave musicians to Indian rulers in Gujarat, to get access to these markets. Bharuch was one of the few ports, where slaves were brought in. <br>A new book ‘The Prestige Makers: Greek Slave Women in Ancient India’ by Kathryn Hain brought out by Journal of World History, quotes the Greek mariner’s guide to western Indian ocean, ‘Periplus Maris Erythraei’, written in a period dating back between 60 AD to 80 AD, where traders were advised that in order to gain permission to trade in Barygaza in Gujarat, “For the king, there was imported in those times precious silverware, slave musicians, beautiful girls for concubinage, fine wines, etc.” The “prosperous city” the Greek text book mentions was located on the Narmada River and was the “meeting point of foreign traders and Indian products that came down-river from Ujjain. <br>A vital text of administrative documents from Gujarat, Lekhapaddhati, from 1230 CE , was translated by Prof Pushpa Prasad’s in her book , “Female Slavery in Thirteenth-Century Gujarat: Documents in the Lekhapaddhati,” which claims that not just customers, but also owners could use violence to coerce their slave girls. It was legal to “punish her by kicking and catching her by the hair and tying up and beating her.” If a prostitute refused a customer after a service agreement was made, she could be fined eight times her fee unless the king was involved, then the punishment increased to 1,000 lashes. Prasad retired as a professor from Aligarh Muslim University. <br>Another early text called Rajatarangini, (“River of Kings”) chronicling early India in 1148 AD was quoted by historian Anant Altekar in his research ‘The Position of Women’, mentioning the presence of dancing girls around the temple town of Somanatha. Many Indian sources mention Yavani (Greek) sex workers, courtesans, or flute girls. But then these women carved a role for themselves in Indian culture. This evidence of presence of Greeks in the western region is corroborated in the Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman around 150 AD which mentions the Greek presence in the area of Aparanta, the coastal trading region encompassing north-western India from Gujarat to Sindh. Another inscription on the Heliodoros pillar at Besnagar, which provides evidence that Greeks were also adherents of the Bhagavata cult of Krishna worship in the second century BCE, according to another book by Richard Salomon, called ‘Indian Epigraphy; A guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages.’ <br></div>","<div class=""_3Mkg- byline""><span><a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Paul-John-34709513.cms"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" frmappuse=""1"">Paul John</a></span> | TNN | Updated: Dec 7, 2020, 14:13  IST</div>",,
