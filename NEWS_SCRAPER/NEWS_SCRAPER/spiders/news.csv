The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has detected significant adulteration in the form of sugar syrups in honey sold by leading brands. This followed laboratory tests in India and abroad. <br>CSE discovered that while the tests being carried out in India, based on the guidelines of <!-- -->Food Safety and Standards Authority of India<!-- --> (FSSAI), can detect C3 and C4 sugar adulteration (based on the natural source of sugar), a fructose syrup solution being imported from China in large quantities over the past four to five years goes undetected. <br><div data-pos=""8"" class=""id-r-component _39c8C undefined

Studies from time to time have shown traces of pesticides found in vegetables and unhealthy additives in fast food. Governments cannot take this issue lightly and must crack down hard on adulteration.</p><small></small></div></div><br>The samples that had adulteration up to 50% passed the Indian tests. CSE also collected 22 samples of branded honey from the market and sent these abroad for a <!-- -->nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy<!-- --> (NMR) test, which is globally accepted but not carried out in India. Only three out of 13 brands passed the test for adulteration, and out of the 22, only five were able to pass the test. <br>The food researchers of CSE had selected 13 brands — both big and small — of processed and raw honey being sold in India. Their samples were first tested at the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) at the <!-- -->National Dairy Development Board<!-- --> in Gujarat. At this stage, almost all the top brands (except Apis Himalaya) passed the tests of purity while a few smaller brands failed the tests to detect C4 sugar, which is adulteration using sugar derived from sugarcane. CSE then sent the same brands for NMR testing to a lab in Germany and almost all brands failed, with the lab stating that a sugar syrup had been mixed in the honey. <br><div data-type=""embedgroup"" class=""_3ZEVD undefined ""><a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/chinese-syrup-in-honey-check-before-you-buy/articleshow/79536057.cms"" data-setgacategory=""false"" frmappuse=""1""><h4>Chinese syrup in honey? Check before you buy</h4></a></div><br>""It is a food fraud more nefarious and more sophisticated than what we found in our 2003 and 2006 investigations into soft drinks; more damaging to our health than perhaps anything that we have found till now — keeping in mind the fact that we are still fighting a killer Covid-19 pandemic with our back to the wall. This overuse of sugar in our diet will make it worse,"" said CSE director general Sunita Narain on Wednesday, releasing the study which was conducted over four months. <br>Amongst the big brands, Dabur, Patanjali, Apis-Himalaya, Baidyanath, Zandu and Hitkari are claimed to have failed the NMR tests, while Patanjali, Baidyanath and Hitkari also failed to pass the trace marker test for rice syrup (TMR), another test to judge the purity of honey which is not part of FSSAI’s standards for Indian honey. Apis-Himalaya, meanwhile, failed to clear some of the Indian tests too. Other brands like Dadav, Indigenous, Hi Honey and Societe Naturelle also failed the NMR tests with Dadav and Hi Honey failing the basic Indian tests too. <br>The three brands out of the 13 which cleared all tests, including NMR, were Saffola, Markfed Sohna and Nature’s Nectar (one sample). <br>The study has found that most brands of honey being sold in the country are adulterated with sugar syrup. ""This is immensely worrying as it will further compromise our health in the troubled times of Covid-19. We know that households today are consuming more honey because of its intrinsic goodness — antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Our research has found that most of the honey sold in the market is adulterated with sugar syrup. Therefore, instead of honey, people are eating more sugar, which will add to the risk of Covid-19. Sugar ingestion is directly linked to obesity, and obese people are more vulnerable to life-threatening infections,"" added Narain. <br>While FSSAI has in the past year directed importers and state food commissioners to look out for ""golden syrup"", ""<!-- -->invert sugar syrup<!-- -->"" and ""rice syrup"" in honey, CSE says it found that high amounts of a fructose syrup were instead being imported from China, with a number of Chinese websites claiming this solution can pass all Indian tests. <br>In the past four years, more than 11,000 metric tonnes of fructose syrup has come to India (70% of this is from China). According to the NGO, when it contacted these Chinese companies posing as a honey company based in India which was looking for a syrup that could bypass Indian standards, companies in China claimed they could adulterate up to 50% to 80% of honey with this syrup and still pass the Indian tests. CSE says it procured the syrup, which came through Hong Kong to bypass customs clearance and was exported as a ""paint pigment"". <br>Narain says they gathered pure honey and carried out three tests of their own, adulterating it with 25%, 50% and 75% of the ""all-pass"" syrup and found the solutions with up to 50% of the syrup could clear all FSSAI tests. Interestingly, the study says, the technology to develop this syrup locally has also been exported by China to India with a factory set up in Jaspur, Uttarakhand. <br>""What we found was shocking,"" says Amit Khurana, programme director of CSE’s Food Safety and Toxins team. ""It shows how the business of adulteration has evolved so that it can pass the stipulated tests in India."" <br>As of August 1, 2020, NMR tests have been made mandatory in India for honey that is meant for export, suggesting that the Indian government is aware of the need for more advanced tests. <br>Narain said all companies should be required to trace back the origins of their honey — from the beekeeper to the hive. It has also asked for strengthening of the Indian testing system and stopping of imports of syrup and honey from China. <br></div>","<div class=""_3Mkg- byline""><span><a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Jasjeev-Gandhiok-479247118.cms"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" frmappuse=""1"">Jasjeev Gandhiok</a></span> | TNN |  Dec 3, 2020, 09:07  IST</div>"

It appeared to be a <!-- -->suicide pact<!-- -->. There have been 42 such suicide cases in <!-- -->Bareilly<!-- --> division in just two years. These are among 58 cases of people dying because they chose to be with someone from another caste. <br>“When I was transferred to Bareilly, I observed a strange pattern — <!-- -->many couples<!-- --> were killing themselves. I started putting together the data,” Bareilly DIG Rajesh Pandey told TOI. He found 16 people had been allegedly killed for being in an inter-caste relationship since January 2019 — there had been 12 <!-- -->murders<!-- --> and two double murders (in which both partners were dead). The pressure also led to 42 people killing themselves — Pandey recorded eight suicides and 17 couple suicides in Bareilly division — the four districts of Shahjahanpur, <!-- -->Pilibhit<!-- -->, Budaun and Bareilly. <br>On Wednesday, the <!-- -->Allahabad high court<!-- --> said that no one can interfere if two adults choose to be with one another. “While <!-- -->the Supreme Court<!-- --> said khap panchayats are illegal, parents often end up playing the same role,” said Pandey. <br>Like in the case of Vikas Soni, 34, and Parul Rawat, 32. Vikas was arrested in September this year because Parul’s parents had filed a “fake” abduction complaint — they had married Parul to another man, whom she had left for Vikas. When police were taking them to Lucknow from Bareilly, where they had been living, they quietly consumed poison. Both died before they got to Lucknow. “All the couple wanted to do was lead a peaceful life. But her family could not get past the caste differences,” Pandey said. <br>Sometimes, it goes beyond emotional and social pressures. Anju Devi, 19, and her husband Sachin, 20, were found murdered in June last year. Anju had married Sachin against her family’s wishes because they were from different castes. Police booked her family. In a disturbingly similar fashion, in January this year, Kuldeep Kashyap, 21, and Durga Saxena, 19, were found dead in a forest outside Bareilly. The two had married against the very strong wishes of Durga’s family. While an <!-- -->FIR<!-- --> was registered, investigation is still on. <br>“In murder cases, FIRs are lodged. In suicide cases, even that does not happen and no action is taken against those who may have pressured the couple and possibly pushed them over the edge. Because these would be the same people who were close to them — parents, relatives,” said Pandey. “Police or the district social welfare officer should be able to take suo motu cognizance of such cases. Police investigation should be mandated. A monitoring committee — with a DM, SSP and district judge — should be set up. Fundamental rights of individuals are in danger.” <br></div>","<div class=""_3Mkg- byline""><span><a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Kanwardeep-Singh-479242302.cms"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" frmappuse=""1"">Kanwardeep Singh</a></span> | TNN | Updated: Dec 3, 2020, 15:16  IST</div>"

Hackers researched the correct make, model, and pricing of various Haier refrigeration units, Zaboeva said. <br>""Whoever put together this campaign was intimately aware of whatever products were involved in the supply chain to deliver a vaccine for a global pandemic,"" she said. <br>Haier Medical did not return messages seeking comment. <br>Messages sent to the email addresses used by the hackers were not returned. <br>IBM said the bogus Haier emails were sent to around 10 different organizations but only identified one target by name: the European Commission's Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union, which handles tax and customs issues across the EU and has helped set rules on the import of vaccines. <br>Representatives for the directorate-general could not immediately be reached for comment. <br>IBM said other targets included companies involved in the manufacture of solar panels, which are used to power vaccine refrigerators in warm countries, and petrochemical products that could be used to derive dry ice. <br>Who is behind the vaccine supply chain espionage campaign isn't clear. <br>Reuters has previously documented how hackers linked to <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Iran"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" data-ga=""within_article-topic_link|topic_Iran"" frmappuse=""1"">Iran</a>, <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vietnam"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" data-ga=""within_article-topic_link|topic_Vietnam"" frmappuse=""1"">Vietnam</a>, North Korea, South Korea, China, and Russia have on separate occasions been accused by cybersecurity experts or government officials of trying to steal information about the virus and its potential treatments. <br>IBM's Zaboeva said there was no shortage of potential suspects.

Before that, only three women had very short stints: the first joined in 1973 but left after 2-3 years, the second appointee in 1985 left to join <!-- -->the Directorate General of Civil Aviation<!-- --> and the third, who joined in 1987, died in harness. <br>After training at the Civil Aviation Training College in Allahabad, Haldar’s first posting was in Kolkata in 1991 where she, along with Aryama Sanyal (now Indore airport director), were the only women controllers. <br>She proved her mettle from the word go. Her male colleagues soon realised she had an edge over them. “A controller is required to be sincere and attentive. While all controllers have these skill-sets, we soon realised women can be more attentive. She was confident and bold,” recounted <!-- -->Kolkata ATC<!-- --> joint GM (automation in-charge) Asit Sinha, one of the controllers who saw her on the first day at work in 1991. <br>In the years that followed, Haldar qualified all the on-the-job examinations with aplomb and received the tower rating, followed by approach rating and area rating before finally bagging the ultimate rating to become the country’s first woman radar controller. <br>“Since the job does not require brawn, women get a level playing field. This coupled with the inherent pressures at home that girls experience in India, remaining calm and focused in pressure situation comes naturally to women. I was mentally strong and always gave my best. Strange as it may sound, I had imagined I would be here one day,” she told TOI. <br>A single mother, Haldar managed both her home and job efficiently. “I’ve followed a simple practice. I don’t take my home to work and don’t bring work home. I try to give my best to the job at hand. I dare say both my daughter and my job have rewarded me for the sincerity,” she said. <br>Kolkata ATC joint GM (training in-charge of enroute stream) Purbita Thakur Sinha, who joined the team a year later, says she was struck by Haldar’s self-assurance and confidence the first time they met. “What sets her apart is her ability to fearlessly speak her mind. Her thoroughness and professionalism command respect,” she said. <br>Others, too, readily acknowledge her competent handling of previous responsibilities — controller in Kolkata and Ranchi; training in-charge at Nagpur; shift in-charge in Kolkata, and air traffic services in-charge in Guwahati. <br>“She was the first woman who accepted the challenge of ATC and enjoyed her profession. She is a very successful ATCO and ATC administrator,” said AAI executive director (air traffic management) Kalyan Chowdhury. <br>Haldar is looking forward to an exciting tenure in Kolkata, managing the team of 300-odd controllers, implementing new rostering with time limitation norms for controllers and overseeing the migration to the new ATC tower and technical block once construction is complete. <br></div>","<div class=""_3Mkg- byline"">TNN | Updated: Dec 3, 2020, 09:37  IST</div>"

The lender has also asked the bank’s board to examine the lapses and fix accountability. <br>The country’s largest private bank informed the stock exchange on Wednesday that the order from the RBI was issued on December 2, and was in response to outages in the bank's internet banking/ mobile banking/ payment utilities over the past two years. The most recent outage took place on November 21 when many customers could not access their digital banking. The bank blamed this on a power failure in its primary data centre. <br>“The RBI vide said Order has advised the Bank to temporarily stop i) all launches of the digital business generating activities planned under its program ‐ Digital 2.0 (to be launched) and other proposed business generating IT applications and (ii) sourcing of new credit card customers. In addition, the order states that the Bank’s Board examines the lapses and fixes accountability,” HDFC Bank said in a letter to the stock exchanges. <br>The bank’s group head of IT and CIO Munish Mittal had put in his papers in July 2020. Last month the bank had named Ramesh Lakshminarayanan of Crisil as its new CIO. <br>Although HDFC Bank has said that the problem was a one-off issue, customers have been taking to the social media to complain against an issue with server delays with regard to receipt of one-time password and authorisation of transactions. <br>HDFC Bank in a statement said that it has taken several measures to fortify its IT systems and will continue to move swiftly to close out the balance and to engage with the regulator in this regard. This is the first time RBI has taken such a drastic action against a large bank. HDFC Bank is the most digital of all Indian lenders and sees over 90% of transactions through non-branch channels. <br>“The bank has endeavoured to provide seamless banking services to its customers. The bank has been taking conscious, concrete steps to remedy the recent outages on its digital banking channels and assures its customers that it expects the current supervisory actions will have no impact on its existing credit cards, digital banking channels and existing operations. The bank believes that these measures will not materially impact its overall business,” the statement said. <br></div>","<div class=""_3Mkg- byline""><span><a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Mayur-Shetty-5033.cms"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" frmappuse=""1"">Mayur Shetty</a></span> | TNN | Updated: Dec 3, 2020, 13:17  IST</div>"

Technological leadership in electric-powered and fully networked driving is the aim of the supervisory board and management board. We are providing Audi with the necessary resources for this,” says Herbert Diess, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Audi AG. <br></div>","<div class=""_3Mkg- byline"">TIMESOFINDIA.COM | Updated: Dec 3, 2020, 15:22  IST</div>"

The Aussies chased down the paltry 75-run target in 11.2 overs with nine wickets to spare and 52 balls remaining. <br><div data-pos=""13"" class=""id-r-component _39c8C undefined

Thoughts of a ‘Super Over’ was on everyone's minds, but the stylish left-hander finished it off in style by hitting a four over point inflicting a 3-0 whitewash on the Aussies. <br>Watson was named the man of the match in a losing cause as his score of 124 was the highest and also the only century of the match. <br><span class=""strong"">November 21, 2018 (1st T20I) - Australia beat India by 4 runs (D/L) in Brisbane</span><br>It was the first T20I of India's tour of Australia in 2018-19.
